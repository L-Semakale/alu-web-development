<h1>Web Development Essentials</h1>

<h2>Understanding HTML</h2>
<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of web development. It provides the structure for web pages, defining the elements that make up a webpage such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.</p>

<h2>CSS for Styling</h2>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML elements, making them visually appealing and enhancing the user experience. With CSS, you can control the layout, colors, fonts, and other design aspects of your website.</p>

<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
<p>Responsive web design ensures that your website looks and functions well on various devices and screen sizes, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This involves using CSS media queries and flexible layouts to adapt to different viewing environments.</p>

<h3>Introduction to JavaScript</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. With JavaScript, you can create interactive forms, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), handle user events, and much more.</p>
